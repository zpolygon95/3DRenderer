Instructions:

I built this project using Netbeans IDE, but it would take some work in order to be able to open it in netbeans.

If you would only like to run the project independent of the IDE, the look in the directory of this project:
	/3DRenderer/RayTracing/dist/RayTracing.jar
and run it as an executable jar file (DISCLAIMER: I am in no way responsible for what you choose to do with this file.
If you choose to do something with it that causes damage to your computer, that is your own fault.)

If you would like to be able to open the project in netbeans, create a directory
	C:/dev/_Github/3DRenderer
and put all of the project files in there. (untested)

Keyboard inputs:

q            -move camera position down
w            -move camera position forward
e            -move camera position up
a            -move camera position to the left
s            -move camera position backward
d            -move camera position to the right

Up arrow     -tilt camera angle up
Left arrow   -rotate camera angle to the left
Down arrow   -tilt camera angle down
Right arrow  -rotate camera angle to the right
Page up      -roll the camera clockwise
Page down    -roll the camera counter-clockwise

===========
||WARNING||
===========

this project is slightly broken. the camera movement and rotation breaks if you go behind the cube in the field of view.
I included a 250x250 version so that it would render quickly for you guys!
keep in mind that this is all VERY rough...
